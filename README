How to Load
===========

Once you have installed the files on your computer, open your favorit web
browser, navigate to the folder where you installed the files, and open
`index.html`.


Optimizations
=============

index.html
----------
- remove the Open Sans font
- embed the `print` and `style` style sheets
- remove Google Analytics
- resize images

views (aka Pizzaria)
--------------------
- improved readability by using four space indentations instead of two
  space ;)
- move the movingPizzas1 acquisition outside the for-loop, and use
  getElementById
- move the pizzasDiv acquisition outside the for-loop
- save initial values of randomPizzaContainer's size and
  randomPizzas' offset width so they don't cause forced layout
- save values of document.body.scrollTop and items' length to save
  lookups during for-loop
- put the sliding background pizzas into a requestAnimationFrame
- calculate the number of background pizzas needed

- add transform to css mover class
